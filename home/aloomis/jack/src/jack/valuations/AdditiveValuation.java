 * This class defines a Valuation function by assigning a linear and/or an exponential
 * scoring factor to the number of a type of good owned by a client.  If the client
 * has multiple types of goods, the value of each type is computed separately, and the
 * total score awarded to the player is the sum of these values.  That is, the marginal
 * value of a good is independent of number of goods a client has of other types, though
 * the exponential factor for the particular type of good under consideration allows for
 * complementarity or substitutability (marginal goods of the same type become worth more
 * or less depending on how many of that type of good the client already has).
